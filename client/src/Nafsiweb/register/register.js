Data Capture: Write JavaScript to capture data from all form fields when the form is submitted.
Data Validation:
Ensure all required fields are filled out. Validate the email format. Check if the user has selected a preferred contact method. If the "I accept terms and conditions" checkbox is checked, display a confirmation message.
Data Processing:
Store the form data in an object for easy access.
Display:
Dynamically display the captured form data in a designated section of the webpage (e.g., a "Form Summary" section) after the form is submitted. Update the displayed data in real-time as the user makes changes to the form.
Interactivity:
Provide real-time feedback to the user as they fill out the form (e.g., display a message if the email format is incorrect). Use event listeners to handle form submissions and data changes. Display a confirmation message when the form is successfully submitted.
